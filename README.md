## Real-Time Traffic Sign Detection and Recognition System

This repository contains code and resources for a real-time traffic sign detection and recognition system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and YOLO v3. The system features real-time detection, classification, and voice alerts for immediate user feedback. Traffic signs are classified into four primary categories: mandatory, prohibitory, dangerous, and others, and further divided into 42 subcategories.

## Technologies Used
- **CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks)**: Used for training the traffic sign detection and classification models.
- **YOLO v3**: Implemented for real-time object detection to localize traffic signs in video streams.
- **OpenCV**: Utilized for image and video processing tasks, including real-time video capture, manipulation, and display.
- **Python**: Programming language used for implementation of the system.
- **LabelMe**: Used for annotating and labeling the training dataset.

## Key Features
- **Real-time Detection**: The system detects traffic signs in real-time using YOLO v3.
- **Classification**: Traffic signs are classified into mandatory, prohibitory, dangerous, and others, and further into 42 subcategories.
- **Voice Alerts**: Provides voice alerts to notify users about detected traffic signs for immediate feedback.
- **Enhanced Road Safety**: Aims to enhance road safety by providing timely alerts to drivers, potentially reducing accidents caused by missed or misinterpreted signs.
